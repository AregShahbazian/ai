# Orion — Workflow Root (Overview)

Root index for Orion's planning docs. Start here. Orion is the real mapping app
(GPS tracking + offline maps); `~/git/track` was the buggy POC (inspiration only).

## Canonical docs
- **MVP definition** → [`mvp.md`](mvp.md) — the first-release scope.
- **Feature backlog** → [`backlog.md`](backlog.md) — unsorted bag of feature ideas (`/feature`).
- **Flutter cheatsheet** → [`cheatsheet.md`](cheatsheet.md) — setup / daily-dev / build commands.
- **Bug fixes** → [`bugfix/`](bugfix/) — `.fix.md` investigation notes.
- **Deps / reference** → [`deps/`](deps/)

## Phases

Each release is delivered in phases. A **phase dir** (`phase-N/`) contains one or
more **task dirs**, and **each task** holds its own workflow docs
(`prd.md` → `design.md` → `tasks.md` → `review.md`).

### Phase 1 — Map Shell (single full-screen map, Philippines focus)
- **Map Shell** → [`phase-1/map-shell/prd.md`](phase-1/map-shell/prd.md) (`id: phase-1-map`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on device (2026-06-04)**; branch `phase-1-map`. (Launcher name/icon to confirm on a release install.)

### Phase 2 — My Location (+ map polish)
User location, plus all the location/map-polish tasks already scoped below.
- **Safe-area HUD** → [`phase-2/safe-area-hud/prd.md`](phase-2/safe-area-hud/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-safe-area`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on device (2026-06-06)**; branch `feature/p2-safe-areas`. PRD only (design/tasks/review pending). Native compass/attribution inset into the safe area + a single `SafeArea` overlay layer for future Flutter HUD.
- **My Location** → [`phase-2/my-location/prd.md`](phase-2/my-location/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-my-location`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on device (2026-06-06)**; branch `feature/p2-my-location`. MapLibre blue dot, foreground permission via `permission_handler`; auto on native, tap-to-locate button on web. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.
- **Follow Me** → [`phase-2/follow-me/prd.md`](phase-2/follow-me/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-follow-me`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on device (2026-06-06)**; branch `feature/p2-follow-me`. Location FAB (ported from track) cycles Off → Follow → Follow+Heading via stock MapLibre tracking modes; manual pan auto-exits; reset button keeps follow. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.
- **Long-press follow zoom** → [`phase-2/followme-longpress-zoom/prd.md`](phase-2/followme-longpress-zoom/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-followme-zoom`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on device (2026-06-07)**; branch `feature/followme-longpress-zoom`. **Native-only** (web already center+zooms on a tap via GL JS `GeolocateControl`): long-pressing the follow FAB does the **tap action first** (cycle), then zooms to `kDefaultFollowZoom` (15) over 1200 ms if that left it following (Off→Follow+zoom, Follow→Follow+Heading+zoom, Follow+Heading→Off no zoom). Two device-found camera races fixed: zoom must run on a **freed camera** (none→zoom→re-enter follow, like `resetOrientation`), and it **waits for the press's center transition to settle** (`onCameraIdle`) before zooming. Gated on the Phase 5 **Long-press-to-zoom** setting. New `id: hud.followMe.longPress` + the `orion.sh logs` dev streamer. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.
- **Heading Arrow** → [`phase-2/heading-arrow/prd.md`](phase-2/heading-arrow/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-heading-arrow`) — ✅ **implemented & verified**; branch `feature/p2-heading-accuracy`. Stock `MyLocationRenderMode.compass` (gated on `enabled`); heading cone on native, plain dot on web. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.
- **Accuracy Circle** → [`phase-2/accuracy-circle/prd.md`](phase-2/accuracy-circle/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-accuracy-circle`) — ✅ **implemented & verified**; branch `feature/p2-heading-accuracy`. No code — MapLibre draws the metric ring by default (native) + web `showAccuracyCircle`; visible at street zoom. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.
- **Reset-orientation button** → [`phase-2/reset-orientation/prd.md`](phase-2/reset-orientation/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-reset-orientation`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on device (2026-06-06)**; branch `feature/p2-reset-orientation`. One Flutter `CompassButton` (replaces native compass) appears on rotate **or** tilt, resets both. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.
- **Dev Logging** → [`phase-2/dev-logging/prd.md`](phase-2/dev-logging/prd.md) (`id: phase-2-dev-logging`) — ✅ **implemented & verified**; branch `feature/p2-dev-logging`. One structured `devLog(scope, data)` path tagged `orion.<scope>` — collapsable in the web console, DevTools Logging tab on Android — so debugging is the same motion everywhere and nothing is lost to flat text. `avoid_print` enforced. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.

### Phase 3 — Interaction Controller (app-global command bus + interaction log)
- **Interaction Controller** → [`phase-3/interaction-controller/prd.md`](phase-3/interaction-controller/prd.md) (`id: phase-3-interaction-controller`) — ✅ **implemented (done for now)**; branch `feature/p3-interaction-controller` (pushed). One app-global channel for every meaningful interaction: **dispatch** programmatically (as if the user did them) and **observe + locally log** the last N. Hand-rolled command bus + ring-buffer interceptor (decided against `flutter_bloc` — Orion is plain `ChangeNotifier`), closed hierarchical taxonomy (`domain.subject.action`). HUD/map interactions retrofitted to dispatch through it; web-only dev console bridge (`orion.dispatch(...)`). **Map camera gestures** (`map.{zoom,scroll,rotate,tilt}.changed`) captured on settle via a record-only `observe()` half (MapLibre runs them natively — nothing to execute) and re-dispatchable to drive the camera. In-memory only — persistence/export deferred. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.

### Phase 4 — HUD (shared HUD controls)
One consistent style for every map-HUD control, so new buttons (the Phase 5
settings cog, future recording controls) reuse one base instead of reinventing it.
- **Shared HudButton** → [`phase-4/hud-button/prd.md`](phase-4/hud-button/prd.md) (`id: phase-4-hud-button`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on web + Android**; branch `feature/p4-hud-button`. One reusable HUD-button base (44 dp circle + shadow fixed; per-button bg/fg color, `Semantics` label, 48 dp tap target); migrated `CompassButton` + `LocationFab` onto it. Also landed: **edge-to-edge transparent system bars** (re-asserted on resume); **dropped the Philippines default region** (whole-world default, then follow the user); and **own the web map attribution** — hide MapLibre's uncontrollable web attribution via CSS and render a custom compact, expandable `MapAttribution` "ⓘ" bottom-right with the FAB lifted clear (native keeps the plugin's bottom-left attribution). maplibre-gl pinned to exact 5.24.0. Fixed a web bug where touch taps leaked through HUD controls to the map (`PointerInterceptor`) — see [`bugfix/2026-06-07-compass-reset-web-touch.fix.md`](bugfix/2026-06-07-compass-reset-web-touch.fix.md). Full PRD→design→tasks→review.

### Phase 5 — App shell (navigation + settings)
Stand up the app shell: leave the live map for a full-screen page and come back
with the map kept alive — then make that first page (**Settings**) real with
persisted on-device toggles.
- **Navigation** → [`phase-5/navigation/prd.md`](phase-5/navigation/prd.md) (`id: phase-5-navigation`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on web + Android (2026-06-07)**; branch `feature/p5-navigation`. `go_router` (17.3.0) with **plain stacked routes** — the map is the home route and screens `push` over it, so `Navigator` keeps the map alive (no remount/reload); `ShellRoute` was evaluated and dropped (its `child` is meant to be the body, not a backdrop — forced transparent-route + `IgnorePointer` hacks). HUD **cog** (below the location FAB) → `/settings` (empty placeholder). Nav modelled in the Phase 3 taxonomy both ways (`hud.settings.tap`, `nav.screen.open/close`); `push` opens, back = `nav.screen.close` (a pop) so Android back is intuitive; a `NavigatorObserver` records **system back** too (guarded against double-recording). Open handlers fire-and-forget the `push` (its Future resolves only on pop). Dev bridges: web `orion.webnav.dump()/.location()`; mobile `ext.orion.webnav` + `scripts/mobile/webnav.sh` / `navto.sh`. **No custom navigation plumbing** — off-the-shelf go_router. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.
- **Settings** → [`phase-5/settings/prd.md`](phase-5/settings/prd.md) (`id: phase-5-settings`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on device (2026-06-07)**; branch `feature/followme-longpress-zoom`. The empty placeholder becomes a real page: `SettingsController` (ChangeNotifier singleton, **`shared_preferences`**-backed, on-device only — no backend) loaded in `main` before `runApp`; two **`SwitchListTile`** toggles dispatched through the interaction bus (`settings.longPressZoom.set` / `settings.logEvents.set`). **Long-press-to-zoom** (default on, native-only — tile hidden on web) gates the Phase 2 follow-FAB long-press; **Log interaction events** (default off) — the persisted owner of what was `InteractionController.logEvents`, so the in-app switch and the dev consoles (`orion.logEvents` / `orion.sh logEvents`) share one value that survives restarts. Full PRD→design→tasks→review.

### Phase 6 — Import / export tracks
- **Import / Export Tracks** → [`phase-6/import-export/prd.md`](phase-6/import-export/prd.md) (`id: phase-6-import-export`) — ✅ **implemented & verified on web + Android (2026-06-07)**; merged to `main`; branch `feature/p6-import-export`. Import **Gaia** (one file, many `<trk>`) + **MyTracks** (one file per `<trk>`) GPX via `file_picker` (multi-select, post-pick validation); **each `<trk>` → one entry** (15-track Gaia file → 15 entries), **no dedup**, name/desc/**color** preserved & round-tripped. **Drift** (SQLite) on web (WASM) + mobile; **stats computed once at import** (distance/duration/avg+max speed/elev gain-loss/min-max), points stored full-res for re-export & Phase 7. Non-blocking import with a **track-count badge** on the header import icon; **reactive Drift-stream list**; tap row → full-stats detail; ⋮ `PopupMenuButton` → **Export** (single-track GPX; client-side, no backend — share sheet on mobile / browser download on web). New **Tracks `HudButton`** (between follow-me FAB & settings cog) → nested `/tracks` + `/tracks/:id` (map stays alive, Phase 5). Taxonomy both ways (`hud.tracks.tap`, `tracks.import.start`, `tracks.open`, `tracks.export` — drivable via `orion.dispatch`). Parser ported from `track/` and **re-verified** on the real samples. No folders/grouping/batch (deferred — see backlog). Full PRD→design→tasks→review. *(Codegen needs `dart run build_runner build --force-jit` on this toolchain — see review.)*

### Phase 7 — Render tracks on map
Draw imported tracks on the map. Must be **efficient and scalable to much more
data** than a single track: use the efficient drawing callback/API `track` used to
keep the map smooth with multiple large tracks, and avoid unnecessary
re-renders/repaints. Confirm our impl is at least as efficient. No PRDs yet.

### Phase 8 — Track recording
Record tracks live: new HUD button(s) to start/stop, store tracks **locally**.
**No account/backend yet.** More details to follow. No PRDs yet.

### Phase 9 — Offline maps
The MVP **offline map storage** feature (see [`mvp.md`](mvp.md) §4). Download map
regions for offline use: **rectangle-draw selection** → pick zoom range → download
with progress + per-region size estimate; show **downloaded regions** vs regions
**queued / currently downloading**; use downloaded tiles **seamlessly when
offline**. User interactions mirror the `track` POC (which already bulk-downloads
OpenFreeMap `liberty` via `downloadOfflineRegion`) and line up with Google Maps /
Gaia GPS. OpenFreeMap public server for MVP1; self-host PH tiles post-MVP1. No PRDs yet.

### Phase 10 — Offline maps custom shapes
Extend Phase 9's region selection beyond a plain rectangle to **custom shapes**
(freeform / polygon draw) so users download only the area they need instead of an
over-wide bounding box — fewer wasted tiles, smaller downloads. Builds on the
Phase 9 download/queue/progress pipeline. No PRDs yet.

### Phase 11 — Language support (i18n)
Localize **as much of the app as possible** — **at least 2 languages** to start
(**English** + **Tagalog/Filipino**, matching the PH focus; `~/git/track` already
had `app_en.arb` / `app_tl.arb` to mine). Set up `flutter_localizations` + `intl`
with ARB message files, **externalize every user-facing string** (the lone
`_kLocationDeniedMessage` const today folds in here), follow the device locale with
an optional in-app override, and keep it easy to add more languages later. Built so
any new feature ships its strings localized from the start. No PRDs yet.

### Phase 12 — DevOps (backend stack)
Stand up Orion's backend/infra once it needs a real server (accounts, sync, CRUD
APIs, shared data). **Locked stack** → [`phase-12/stack.md`](phase-12/stack.md):
**Caddy** edge (HTTPS/TLS + reverse-proxy) → **Dart `shelf`** API on
`localhost:8080` → **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** (spatial queries), run under
**systemd** (no Docker), schema via **dbmate**. Purely additive — the existing
GitHub Actions SSH/rsync deploy + Caddy static serving are untouched. No PRDs yet.

> Note: "Phase 5 — Navigation" is **app-screen navigation**, not GPS routing/A→B
> routing, which remains out of scope (see [`mvp.md`](mvp.md)).

## Key decisions (quick reference)
- App: name **Orion**, `applicationId com.mby4m.orion` (track was unpublished).
- Stack: Flutter + **`maplibre_gl` v0.26.1** + SQLite (Drift). **Web and Android are both first-class production targets** — web is web-first for the *dev loop*, but it ships to real users too (and may gain web-only features later), so it must be production-quality, not just a dev convenience. Phone for native testing. iOS deferred.
- Decentralization: **post-MVP**; local-first + central sync.
- iOS: deferred, kept clean.
- Export: **GPX first** (KML/others later). Offline UX mirrors `track`.
- Tiles: OpenFreeMap public server for **MVP1**; **self-host PH tiles post-MVP1**.
- Background recording target: **wide range of common PH Android phones** (incl. aggressive OEMs).
- **Interactions:** every new user action wires through the `InteractionController` **both ways** — captured (`dispatch`/`observe`) and programmatically dispatchable; reachable remotely via `window.orion` (web) and `ext.orion.*` VM service extensions (native, `scripts/mobile/orion.sh`). No inline-handler bypass. See `phase-3/interaction-controller/design.md`.
- **Persistent state, transient screens:** expensive, long-lived state (the map + controller, and later track/route/waypoint data) is owned by a persistent root shell, created **once**; navigation never unmounts/re-creates it. The map stays alive across navigation (no remount/reload/re-fit); data pages **never fetch on mount** — they observe a long-lived controller that fetched once, so navigating to/from them is instant and re-fetch only happens the first time. Tearing the map down for a specific page is an explicit, per-destination opt-out, never the default. (`track`'s laggy nav came from violating this.) See `phase-5/navigation/prd.md`.

(Durable decisions also live in memory — see `MEMORY.md` pointers prefixed `orion:`.)
